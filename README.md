## Getting Started

The BabyLoans web3 front-end is written in react. 
It is a fork of Ethereum-Boilerplate.

To get started, first clone this repo:

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/BabyLoans/front.git && cd front
```

Next, install yarn dependencies (note, you should not use `npm` intsead of `yarn` during `install` because `npm` does not respect `yarn.lock` but you should be able to use `npm` for the other commands.):

Next, start your development server for the front-end:

```bash
> yarn start
```

## Deployment

Coming soon...
